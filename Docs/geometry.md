# Geometric framing

This model treats ecosystem stability as a property of 
energy basins in phase space rather than a property of 
individual species.

Key structural features:

**Basin depth** corresponds to the energetic distance 
between current system state and nearest bifurcation 
threshold. Deep basins require large perturbations to 
reorganize. Shallow basins reorganize under small forcing.

**System frequency** is determined by dominant organism 
time constants. Long-lived species produce low-frequency 
dynamics. Short-lived species produce high-frequency dynamics.
Warming compresses time constants, raising system frequency.

**Trophic mismatch** occurs because Q10 values differ 
across trophic levels. Base-of-pyramid processes accelerate 
faster than apex processes. Energy interception at lower 
levels increases before apex demand can adjust.

**Ecological memory** is the temporal integration window 
of the system. Operationally: the lifespan of dominant 
long-lived species. Compression of lifespan compresses 
the integration window. High-frequency environmental 
variation propagates further into the food web unchecked.

**Spatial autocorrelation** determines effective landscape 
continuity for large-bodied species. Below connectivity 
thresholds, fragmentation costs compound nonlinearly.

These are not independent variables. They interact.
Temperature forcing affects basin depth, system frequency, 
trophic mismatch, and ecological memory simultaneously.

The model is designed to make these interactions visible,
not to predict specific outcomes.
