# Interpretation notes

## What this model is

A minimal dynamical framework for examining how 
temperature forcing interacts with trophic structure,
spatial continuity, and organism time constants.

It is not a predictive model.
It is a geometric model.

The distinction matters.

Predictive models attempt to forecast specific outcomes
from specific inputs. They require empirical calibration,
validation data, and explicit uncertainty quantification.

Geometric models attempt to make structural relationships
visible. They ask: given these interaction rules, what 
shapes emerge? Where are the thresholds? How do variables
couple?

This model is of the second type.

## What the outputs mean

**Diverging lines** on trophic acceleration plots indicate
rate mismatch. The gap between microbial and apex curves
is not incidental — it is the primary mechanism by which
warming reduces energy available to slow integrators even
when total primary production holds steady or increases.

**Threshold crossings** on viability plots indicate 
bifurcation points — places where incremental change
produces qualitative state change. The threshold is not
a prediction of when collapse occurs. It is a structural
feature of the landscape. Systems approaching thresholds
become more sensitive to perturbation before crossing them.

**Energy balance sign change** from positive to negative
indicates the point at which apex metabolic demand exceeds
available supply under the model assumptions. Stochastic
variation shows that deficit conditions can occur episodically
before the deterministic crossover —​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
